# Durham-County-Property-Tax-Analysis

Property taxes are an important part of local government revenue; they are a majority of what goes into funding public schools, parks, and other local public goods. Local governments have revenue goals which are used to set property tax rates.


Property taxes are typically decided on by local governments and each county in a state will have their own tax rate.  How much you pay in taxes is based on the assessed value of your property. Durham County is right next to the capital and is a mostly urban and centralized county. There are over 3000 counties in the US with North Carolina having 100 of those. 

We are not as interested in prediction as you can just calculate your tax bill, rather we are interested in determining the factors that contribute the most to tax bills (inference).
